### Introduction
A health app is a software program that can be used on a mobile device or desktop to process health-related data. The entire project is divided into a client-server architecture, and hence, two different projects have been created but checked into one Git repository:

- **frontend**
- **backend**

### Key Features

#### Doctor-Patient Appointment Booking and Management
[Explain how appointments can be booked, managed, and updated.]

#### Real-Time Health Monitoring and Record Keeping
[Describe health tracking features, including the use of graphs and record uploads.]

#### GPS Integration for Nearby Hospitals
[Detail the Google Maps API integration for finding nearby hospitals.]

#### Calories Tracking and Alerts
[Explain how users can track calories and receive alerts.]

#### Firebase Google Authentication
[Highlight the secure login implementation using Firebase.]

#### Medical Symptom Assistance Chatbot
[Describe the chatbotâ€™s role and capabilities.]

#### Widget for Easy Navigation
[Outline how the widget simplifies the user experience.]

#### Video Consultations with Jitsi
[Explain the integration of video consultations using Jitsi.]

#### Responsive Website
[Describe how the UI adapts to different screen sizes.]

#### AI Blood Report Analysis
[Explain how AI is used to analyze uploaded blood reports and provide insights, potential diagnoses, and recommendations.]

#### Email Reminders for Appointments
[Describe how email reminders are sent to users regarding their upcoming appointments to ensure timely consultations.]

### Technologies Used
- React.js
- Firebase Authentication
- Google Maps API
- Jitsi (Video Consultations)
- Node.js (Backend)
- Express.js
- CSS/Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap
- AI-based Blood Report Analysis
- Nodemailer (For Email Notifications)

### Installation
In order to run the project locally, developers need to obtain the `.env` file, which contains sensitive information such as the Google Map API Key, database credentials, ChatGPT API key, etc.

#### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samriddhitiwary/IIT_BHU_HealthCare.git
```
All the code will be cloned into the `IIT_BHU_HealthCare` directory. The frontend code is checked into the `frontend` folder, and the backend code is checked into the `backend` folder.

#### Start the backend server
```bash
cd ./IIT_BHU_HealthCare/backend
npm install
npm start
```
This will start the backend server on port 8000 by default. However, the port can be configured in the `.env` file.

#### Start the frontend server
```bash
cd ./IIT_BHU_HealthCare/frontend
npm install
npm start
```
This will start the frontend server on port 3000 by default. However, the port can be configured in the `.env` file.
